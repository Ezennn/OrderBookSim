# OrderBookSim

## Description

Designed a low-latency C++ order matching engine capable of processing 10k+ orders/sec with real-time trade execution. Implemented concurrency control using std::mutex and std::condition_variable, optimized priority-queue data structures for fast order matching, and benchmarked single-thread vs multi-thread performance to simulate trading system workloads.
