# OrderBookSim

## Description

Designed a low-latency C++ order matching engine capable of processing 10k+ orders/sec with real-time trade execution. Implemented concurrency control using std::mutex and std::condition_variable, optimized priority-queue data structures for fast order matching, and benchmarked single-thread vs multi-thread performance to simulate trading system workloads.

Low-Latency Order Book Simulator (C++)  â€“ 
Developed a high-performance order matching engine processing 10k+ orders/sec with real-time trade execution.
Implemented concurrency control (std::mutex, std::condition_variable) and optimized priority queues for fast matching & execution.
Benchmarked single-thread vs multi-thread execution to simulate high-frequency trading workloads.
